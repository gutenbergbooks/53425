<p>Teachers are discovering that no matter how
much novelty there is in their entertainment,
how well it is arranged, how thoroughly
drilled, if they want to hold the active interest
of the audience they must use the best of songs.
The songs must be real novelties. The words
must be interesting as well as decidedly clever.
The music must be catchy and abounding in rich
melody. With these things in mind we have
prepared this list of superior song novelties for
our patrons. All are in regular sheet music form.</p>

<h2>The Dearest Thing in Boots</h2>


<h3>SCENE</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The front room of <span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson’s</span> store used for fitting shoes. A
long table piled with boxes is down stage L, a small table with
cash box, books, paper and cord down stage R, a couple of chairs
and foot rests at C, doors at R and L. <span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> is discovered
leaning against table at R while <span class="smcap">Jack</span> is straddling a chair.</p></div>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: It’s been a whole week, Jack, since you first
came into the store, so if you’ve been keeping your ears
and eyes open, you will have caught on to some of my
methods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Take it from me, dad, I have. They are in a class
by themselves. Summed up briefly, as the minister says,
they are [<i>checks each point on fingers</i>]: Firstly, soak
a customer for all she’s worth, or you think she’s worth.
Secondly, if a shoe is too expensive, take off a <i>cent or
two</i>. Thirdly, if it is too cheap, which doesn’t happen
very often, take it to the rear where you change the
<i>price</i> but not the <i>shoe</i>, bring it back and tuck on a <i>dollar
or two</i>. Fourthly, always side in with everything a
customer says, even if she insists that the moon is made
of green cheese. Fifthly, always, always,—oh, what does
my thumb say, dad? I’ve run out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Never fail to make a sale, that’s what it
says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: That’s it. I knew it was something like that. Do
you want me to start on the other hand, now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: No, that will do to begin with. I’m glad
you’ve been keeping your ears and eyes open so well.
Now, I hope you use your tongue to as good advantage.
Since the only way to learn the shoe business is to stand
firmly on your own feet, I’m going to let you get your
first experience this afternoon in waiting on customers,
by yourself. I will not interfere unless I see that you
are going to lose a sale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>kicking over footrest</i>]: Lose a sale? Not on your
life! Just see me put it all over the dears until they’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
be tumbling over each other to buy. Leave it to your
Uncle Dudley. [<i>Fixes footrest and resumes former position.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Don’t be so sure, young man. There’s many
a spill between the dollar and till and women are pernickety
things to handle at any time. [<i>Bell tinkles.</i>]
Here comes your first customer. Good luck. [<i>Exit
door L.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>cranes neck towards door R.</i>]: If it isn’t Betty
Moffat, the dearest thing in boots. [<i>Jumps up hastily,
overturning chair.</i>] I’m going to sell her the peachiest
shoes in the whole establishment, the little queen!</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Betty</span> door R.</i></p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: Why Jack, are <i>you</i> here? I didn’t even know you
had started to work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>replaces chair</i>]: Well, I like that! I’d like you to
know that I have worked more or less all my young life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: Principally less. I’d imagine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>hits his head</i>]: Did you say this was a slammy day?
Well, I have started to work in earnest this afternoon
for dad has given me the job of waiting on all the
customers and you’re the first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: Am I really? I’m so glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: The pleasure is all mine and—the shelling out all
yours. [<i>Draws himself up pompously.</i>] And what can
I do for you, madam?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>giggles</i>]: Oh Jack, you’re too funny for words.
I want to buy a pair of dancing slippers. Have you any
nice ones?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: It’s a mighty good thing you asked for the nice
ones because we’re out of the other kind. Then you’re
going to the dance tonight? Save me a dozen or two,
won’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>leans parasol against table R. It falls down and
both collide in picking it up</i>]: Oh, look at my hat! It’s
all crooked. [<i>Fixes it.</i>] Is it on straight now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: No, it’s tilted a little to the left side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: Then it <i>is</i> on straight. [<i>Takes mirror from vanity
bag and tilts hat farther.</i>] There, it’s all right now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside</i>]: I never knew that crooked meant straight
before, but one is always learning. [<i>Aloud.</i>] You didn’t
say whether you’d save me those dances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>coquettishly</i>]: I may save you one or two, I’ll
think about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Put your whole mind to it, then. Now just take
this chair. I’m the doctor. And what size do you take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: Two’s and a half.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: By jove, but you have mighty dainty little feet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>pleased</i>]: Do you think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: I don’t think, I know. It will be no feat to fit
them. [<i>Takes a box from table and brings it over.</i>] Here
is just the very thing you want. [<i>Takes out slippers.</i>]
Aren’t they classy? Let me try one on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>kicks off pump</i>]: They are rather nice, aren’t
they? [<i>Puts foot on footrest. Jack tries to put slipper
on, but fails.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: These are too small, Betty. You’ll need a half size
larger. [<i>He starts to go towards table L.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]: They’re not a bit too small. I
never take a larger size than that. [<i>Jerks slipper on.</i>]
There, you see <i>I</i> can get it on. I think you’re real mean,
trying to make out that I have big feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Upon my soul. [<i>Hits sole of boot.</i>] Betty, I’m not
doing anything of the kind. You have the dearest little
feet I have ever seen, but you can see for yourself that
that slipper is too tight. I’d hate to have you get a
horrid corn for somebody to trample on and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>jumps up angrily</i>]: The very idea! There’s only
one boy I’ve danced with who’s ever trampled on my
feet and you’re not going to get the chance tonight, so
there! [<i>Stamps foot with slipper on, grimaces and hops
on one foot.</i>] Ouch!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: I—I—oh, I turned on my ankle. It’s weak you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: It wasn’t the slipper’s fault, was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>indignantly</i>]: Of course it wasn’t; the very idea,
as though it could hurt anything. [<i>Goes behind his
back, takes off slipper and rubs her toes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: But that slam you gave me, you didn’t mean what
you said, did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: What about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Why, my dancing, and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: I do, I mean every word of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Well. I’m sorry, Betty, if I have offended you.
Take these if you want to. All I can say is that I’d hate
to have to stand in your shoes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: I tell you they’re <i>not</i> too small, <i>they’re not, they’re
not, they’re not</i>! But I’ll not take them nor any other
either. [<i>Sits down, takes off slipper and puts on her
own.</i>] You can keep your old slippers.</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> from door L.</i></p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: You’ll have to make allowance for this new
clerk of mine, Miss Moffat. You see you’re his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
customer so he’s pretty green at the business. Let me
try this slipper on. [<i>Picks it up.</i>] Jack, did you use a
shoe horn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>sulkily</i>]: No, I didn’t. Should you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Of course. No wonder you had trouble putting
it on. [<i>Puts it on her foot.</i>] There, it fits perfectly,
Miss Moffat. You have such pretty feet, it’s a pleasure
to fit them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: I’m glad <i>you</i> think so, Mr. Wilson. I’ll take them.
How much are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: They’re twelve dollars, Miss Moffat, but seeing
that you’ve had so much annoyance with our new
clerk, I’m going to let you have them for eleven, ninety-five.
[<i>Wraps them up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>gathering parasol, purse, etc.</i>]: Thank you, Mr.
Wilson. Charge them to dad. [<i>Takes parcel and goes
towards door R.</i>] Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>rushes to open door</i>]: Good-bye, Betty. I’ll see
you at the dance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>haughtily</i>]: <i>You’ll</i> not fail to see my big feet, at
any rate, Mr. Wilson. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>sinks into chair</i>]: The dearest thing in boots! And
now I’ve made her so mad that she’ll never speak to me
again. All over a measely half-size in slippers. Who’d
think a girl could be so silly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Eight
women out of ten want boots too small for them and
won’t take anything else. That’s why women can endure
pain better than men; they get used to it, breaking in
tight shoes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: The Chinese have nothing on them, believe me!
[<i>Shakes finger at father.</i>] And you old fraud you, you
side in with them and then later on sell them corn
plasters and bunion-easers and arch-supports and all the
rest of the instruments of torture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: That’s the great idea, my son. You’re learning
fast. But you must confess that my method is better
than sending a customer away angry, and it has put you
through college, besides, remember that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: I do, dad. Rule number six—always tell a woman
that you’re sure she takes a half-size smaller boot than
you know she does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: That’s it. As a rule it tickles them all to
pieces. And you get their money and their good-will to
boot. [<i>Bell tinkles.</i>] Here’s another customer. Better
luck this time. [<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>. <span class="smcap">Jack</span> busies himself
at table.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>.</i></p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: How do you do, Miss Firmrock, and what can I
do for you today?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: Young man, before I buy anything from
you, I must know how you stand on the woman suffrage
question. Do you believe that women should take an
active part in politics now that they are given the vote?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>taken back</i>]: Do I believe what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: That women should mix up in politics.
[<i>Emphasize words by pounding floor with umbrella.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside</i>]: Now what in the dickens does she want me
to say? From her wording, I’d say she was agin the
petticoat government. [<i>Aloud grandiloquently.</i>] My
dear Madam, the woman’s place is in the home, cooking
the meals, keeping the house clean,—er—er—making
the children’s dresses er—er—winding up the cat and
putting the clock out. Why should women need to enter
into politics? Is not her influence greater at home?
Who has not heard that beautiful and noble sentiment—“The
hand that <i>rules</i> the cradle <i>rocks</i> the world.” [<i>Aside.</i>]
Gee, I didn’t know I was such a speaker. [<i>Starts to
strut.</i>] I hope dad got that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: I knew as soon as I looked at you that
you were one of these lordly males, who believe in keeping
women a slave, a household drudge, with no more rights
than the criminal, the child and the imbecile. If women
do not help to do the governing, who is going to make
decent laws? Who is going to see that the bachelor pays
twice as much in taxes as the man who has a family to
support? Who is going to make this beautiful country of
ours a decent place to live in? The men? [<i>Scornfully.</i>]
They’ve had their try at it ever since Columbus discovered
America. And what have they accomplished?
[<i>Snaps her fingers.</i>] Not that! I want <i>nothing</i> from
you sir. I shall buy only in a store where woman is not
trodden upon. [<i>Starts to go.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside</i>]: Imagine me treading on the likes of her?
But good-night! I’ve backed the wrong horse. How
in the world am I going to fix it? [<i>Taps his head.</i>] I’ve
got it! A little bit of soft soap goes a long way.
[<i>Aloud.</i>] Miss Firmrock, one moment, please. [<i>She turns
at door.</i>] I had never given the matter any thought or
I certainly wouldn’t have said what I did. But you have
enlightened me. [<i>Bowing.</i>] You have made me see that
women must enter the political arena to fight the beasts
of bachelor’s vice and—and—no—backed dresses! You
have shown me that men as uplifters are failures, that
women alone can reform the world. Miss Firmrock, how
can I thank you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span> [<i>comes back to C, shakes his hand</i>]: It
gives me great pleasure to know a man who is so open
to convictions as you are, Mr. Wilson; and I will feel
that I have accomplished something in life since I have
converted you to our cause. But really, Mr. Wilson, I
never knew that you were such an orator. I am going
to put you down for a speech at our Women’s Club next
Wednesday evening. How will this subject suit you,
“The Failures Men Have Made”? [<i>Takes out note-book
and writes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside, pretending to faint against table</i>]: Suffering
cats, what next! [<i>Aloud.</i>] My dear Miss Firmrock,
[<i>aside</i>] Gee, it sounds like a proposal. [<i>Aloud.</i>] I’ve
never made a speech in public in all my life and I—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span> [<i>interrupts</i>]: Then it’s time you were
beginning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>desperately</i>]: Oh, really, I can’t possibly go that
night; I have another engagement; I—I—you see I
have to go to prayer meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: To prayer meeting! I’ve never seen
you there in my life, so you can put off your starting for
another week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside</i>]: If I don’t have nervous prostration by
then, there’s nothing for it but to get myself smashed up
in an auto accident. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Well, I’ll do my best,
Miss Firmrock. Were you wanting to buy anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: Yes, a pair of boots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>pulls chair out</i>]: Now just sit here, Miss Firmrock
and I’ll fit you. What size do you take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: Six and a half.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside as he gets a box from table</i>]: Now, let me
see; the rule I’ve learned by bitter experiences is, “Tell
the dears they have such little feet you’re sure they
should take a smaller size.″ Very well, I’ll just do that
little thing. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Now let me try these sixes on you,
Miss Firmrock. I’m sure you can’t take a larger size
than that, you have such little feet. [<i>Gets down on
knees to fit shoe. <span class="smcap">Miss F.</span> boxes his ears and he tumbles
over.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: How <i>dare</i> you make fun of my feet?
[<i>Whacks him with umbrella. <span class="smcap">Jack</span> jumps up.</i>] I know
they’re large and I’m proud of it. The only people
capable of having big ideas in their heads are the ones
with feet large enough to give them a good understanding.
[<i>Grabs parcels.</i>] I’d like you to know that I’m not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
silly, giggling fashion-plate who insults her feet by sticking
them into shoes far too small for them and then
minces along with her heels raised on stilts. I can see
you can’t suit me so I’ll try another store, and you
needn’t bother about that speech, either. We can manage
without it. [<i>Goes towards door R.</i>]</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>.</i></p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [<i>goes forward and shakes hands</i>]: How-do-you
do, Miss Firmrock. Allow me to congratulate you
on the excellent work you did in the prohibition campaign.
It’s women like you who are bringing about the
reforms that are so badly needed in this country. And
did you get the boots you wanted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: No, I didn’t, this son of yours insulted
me, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Oh, I’m sure he didn’t do it intentionally.
But it is his first day at the shoe business and he hasn’t
gotten onto the hang of it yet. It is a pair of boots you
were wanting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span> [<i>appeased</i>]: Yes, a good sensible boot
that I don’t have to be thinking about all the time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: We have the very thing. [<i>Takes box from
table and shows her a very large boot.</i>] This size is
seven as it doesn’t come in half sizes. You see it has a low
heel, wide last, cushion sole, everything that tends for
comfort. The price is twenty dollars and thirty cents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>: I like the boot immensely, but I wouldn’t
think of paying such a price. It’s exhorbitant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Not for this boot, Madam. This is a very
special boot, designed for broadminded women by the
greatest suffragette leader the world has ever known.
[<i>Impressively.</i>] Madam, this is the <i>Pankhurst</i> boot you
see before you. We are not allowed to sell it to anyone
who has not done something for the great cause. You
have proved yourself worthy, Miss Firmrock. [<i>Bows.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span> [<i>flattered</i>]: Oh, Mr. Wilson, do you really
think so? I’ll take them and [<i>gushes</i>] every time I wear
them, I’ll feel as though they were a bond uniting that
noble woman and me—and I’ll recommend them to every
woman I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: In that case, I’ll give them to you for twenty
and a quarter. Would you like to try them on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span> [<i>pays</i>]: Oh no, I’ll wait until I get home.
[<i>Takes boots.</i>] Good afternoon, Mr. Wilson. I hope
you’ll be able to make something out of your son some
day. He certainly doesn’t seem to take after you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: No, I can’t say that he does. He is just
like his mother. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Firmrock</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>mops his brow</i>]: Good lord, dad. If I have any
more of this, I’ll be a stark, staring lunatic by tonight.
[<i>Shakes finger at him.</i>] And I’ll never trust your old
rules again. Look what that one did for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: But there’s an exception to every rule,
and if you knew anything about feminine psychology,
you would know at a glance that Miss Firmrock was the
exception, the one out of a thousand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Hang feminine psychology and feminine vanity
and feminine feet and feminine everything else! A gents’
establishment for mine! [<i>Brightens up.</i>] But this last
failure of mine has saved you a mighty lot of money and
worry, dad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: How do you make that out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: It has prevented you from having your car smashed
to pieces and your son in the hospital. [<i>Bell tinkles.</i>]
By jove, here’s another customer. This is a Jonah day
for son Jack, all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: That’s a queer name to apply to a busy day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

you this afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span>: Will you show me your litest style in boots?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]: Lightest? Do you mean boots with thin
soles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span>: No, it’s good ’eavy walkin’ boots I want,
but they must be in the litest style. I always gets the
litest in everything. Me ’usband, ’ee tells me I hain’t
anything if not stylish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Is it something in white you were wanting? That
is the lightest color we keep. [<i>Gets white boots.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span>: Oh, no. I want black so that I can wear
them every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: But you said you wanted the lightest—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span>: Yes, the litest in black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside</i>]: The lightest in black! The woman must

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span> [<i>tartly</i>]: Isn’t that what I said, the litest

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>hurriedly</i>]: Yes, certainly, Mrs. Atkins, and we
have the very latest here; never keep any other kind, in
fact. [<i>Places chair for her.</i>] Just take this chair, please.
[<i>Aside.</i>] Now, which class does she belong to, the size
smaller or size larger? Blest, if I know. I’ll try her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
on dad’s Pankhurst dope first. Shouldn’t wonder but
she would fall for that when she’s so English. [<i>Takes
shoe from table and holds it up.</i>] Here, madam, you
have before you the very latest thing in boots, no other
than the Pankhurst, designed by the celebrated suffragette
leader herself and— [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span> <i>knocks boot out of

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span> [<i>vehemently</i>]: Don’t you dare to sell me a
boot that horrid woman’s ’ad anything to do with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside</i>]: Struck it wrong again. Oh the contrariness
of woman. [<i>Aloud.</i>] But my dear madam, surely you’re
an admirer of the woman who was the greatest pioneer
in fighting for the vote for women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span> [<i>jumps up excitedly</i>]: That’s the very reason
I ’ate ’er. Votes for wimen! What does wimen want
with votes? Us women ’ave enough to do to cook our
’usbands’ meals and tend the childrens’ noses and clean
up the ’ouse after the man’s gone to work, leaving hashes
and mud all over the floor, the way he does. [<i>Looks at
boots on table.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside, indicating fourth finger</i>]: This finger says,
Agree with everything a customer says. [<i>Aloud.</i>] That’s
my idea, entirely, Mrs. Atkins. I agree with you there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span> [<i>turns on him</i>]: What do you know about
it, young man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>confused</i>]: Why, I—I—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span>: Hit’s me who’s ’ad to suffer on account of
the wimen being given the vote. My ’usband, ’ee’s a
great one for electioneering, ’ee ’is, but he never used
to leave me alone at nights until wimen got the frances.
[<i>Sobs.</i>] H’ever since then, ’ee’s been spending ’is evenings
in other wimen’s ’omes, teaching them how to vote
and he’s never h’at ’ome any more except for his meals.
Ee do be regular for them, I must si. Ee ’as such an
appetite. [<i>Sighs deeply several times.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside</i>]: So that’s where the shoe pinches! [<i>Aloud.</i>]
Now, that’s too bad, Mrs. Atkins. I don’t blame you for
not wanting the Pankhurst boot. I wouldn’t wear it
myself. I’ll show you something else. What size?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span>: And you’d sigh, too, young man, if you had
the troubles I’ve had, with your ’usband finding fault
with the cooking ever since other wimen have been feeding
him up and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>hurriedly</i>]: What size boot do you take? That’s
what I mean, Mrs. Atkins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span> [<i>gets ready to go</i>]: It doesn’t matter wot
size I tike, for I’m not tiking any boots. That’s the only
style of boot I want hand I’d buy it in a minute if it
didn’t ’ave that odious woman’s nime connected with it.
Not content with breaking windows, she ’as to break up

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span> [<i>tartly</i>]: No, I ’aven’t, not with the Pankhurst
boot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [<i>picks up boot</i>]: Jack, why didn’t you show
her this anti-suffragette style. I’m sure Mrs. Atkins

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span>: <i>The H’ante-suffragette?</i> Why, ’ee told
me it was the Pankhurst and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [<i>looks surprised</i>]: Why, Jack, however could
you make such a mistake as that? The Pankhurst is a
different shoe, altogether. Only dowdy people wear
them. I wouldn’t think of trying to sell that shoe to
<i>you</i>, Mrs. Atkins. But you’ll have to make allowance
for my son, here. You see, this is his first day in selling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and he really doesn’t know one style from the other.
But he’ll soon learn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside as he tidies up the tables</i>]: Not in a thousand
years, believe me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span>: I ’ope so, but ’ee doesn’t look any too bright,
Mr. Wilson. [<i><span class="smcap">Jack</span> shakes fist in her direction.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Everyone says he takes after his mother.
[<i>Holds up boot.</i>] Now, this is the very latest thing we
have, worn by all the fashionable and sensible ladies who
are against this tomfoolery of women voting and entering
into politics. It does nothing but break up homes
and—and—would you like to try it on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atkins</span> [<i>hurriedly</i>]: Oh no, I’m sure it’s the right
size by the looks of it. [<i>Aside.</i>] I wouldn’t for h’anything
let him see the ’ole where my big toe ’as worked
through my stocking. [<i>Aloud.</i>] I’ll tike them, Mr. Wilson
if they’re not too expenses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: The price is ten dollars and forty-five cents,
but I’m only charging you ten-forty on account of the
trouble you have had with my son. [<i>Wraps boots up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: No, why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Then it hasn’t turned grey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [<i>laughs</i>]: It will take more than that to turn
your head grey. But I thought you were going to put
it all over the dears until they would be tumbling over

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: That’s right, rub it in. But when I said that, I
didn’t know that I had to be a politician and a feminine
psychologist and—and an accomplished liar in order to
sell a woman a pair of boots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Not a liar, son. Be careful what you call
your respected parent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Well, if what you have been doing all afternoon

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: The same thing under a fancy name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: Not at all. A lie is telling what is absolutely

of the truth. [<i>Bell tinkles.</i>] Here comes your next

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [<i>comes in quickly</i>]: Just a minute, Mrs.
O’Brien.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Brien</span> [<i>drops bundles</i>]: Howly Moses, and where
be yez afther comin’ from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [<i>picks up shoes</i>]: From the back of the store
and Mrs. O’Brien, I’m very sorry, but you can’t have
these shoes unless you pay cash for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Brien</span>: Pay cash? And Oi’d loike to know how
the loikes of me can pay cash whin Oi haven’t a cint to
my name. Bad cess to yez, yez ould skin-flint. [<i>Shakes
fist in his face.</i>] Yez would skin a flea for its hide, yez
would. May the saints forgit yez and the devil fly away
with yez. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Merciful heavens, dad, isn’t she a howly terror?
But what gets me is after raising my hope to the high
pinnacle of sixty dollars, she shooed them away, worse
luck! I confess, dad, that I’m an out and out failure.
I’ve never put in such a day in all my life. I’ll sell
newspapers, shovel coal, dig ditches or—or—or even
teach school before I’ll put in another. I’m through.
Not another customer will I wait on for all the money
in the world. [<i>Bell tinkles.</i>] There goes that darned
bell. It’s <i>me</i> for the back shop this time. [<i>Hurries
toward door L.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [<i>looks toward entrance</i>]: Why, it’s Betty
Moffat back, I wonder—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>rushes back</i>]: I’ll wait on her, dad. Clear out.</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Betty</span>.</i></p>

<div class="hangsection">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span>: But I thought—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Don’t, it’s bad for the brain. Hustle. [<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Mr.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> [<i>mischievously</i>]: Don’t, it’s bad for the brain.
[<i>Both laugh.</i>] I’ve come back to tell you you were right
and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]: Right? What about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: Why about those slippers; they <i>are</i> too small for
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>aside</i>]: Hanged if I hadn’t forgotten all about
that, but goodness knows I’ve had enough other things to
worry about. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Oh, no, Betty, I’m sure they
are the right size; you have such dear little—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: But they <i>are</i> too small. I tried to dance in them
when I got home and they hurt my feet like everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span> [<i>tenderly</i>]: Poor little feet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: And I want a half size larger. [<i>Sits down. <span class="smcap">Jack</span>
gets slippers and kneels to fit them.</i>] And—and I’m
awfully sorry, Jack, that I was so horrid. I’ve got a
nasty, mean temper and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Now, don’t you dare call yourself names. Why
Betty, you’re the sweetest girl that ever lived, you’re—you’re
the dearest thing in boots!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: That’s just what daddy says when he gets the
bills for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: Oh, but I didn’t mean it that way I— [<i>Aside.</i>]
Hang it, I wish dad weren’t taking in every word I say.
[<i>Calls.</i>] Dad, come on out here and mind your robber’s
den yourself for awhile. Betty and I are going to the
ice-cream parlor. Come on, Betty. [<i>Drags her a few
steps with one pump on.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span>: Really Jack, don’t you think I ought to put my
other pump on first? I wouldn’t like to go like this.
What would people say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack</span>: What a dear little foot! [<i>Puts her slipper on her
foot.</i>] Here you are. Come on. [<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Betty</span> and <span class="smcap">Jack</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson</span> [<i>Enters, picks up slipper and shakes his head.</i>]:
The dearest thing in boots, eh? He’s not far off for I’ll
never be able to sell these. But what’s a pair of these
to my boy’s happiness? [<i>Pours out glass of water and

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
